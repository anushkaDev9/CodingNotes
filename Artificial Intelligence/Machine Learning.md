# Machine Learning ðŸ¤–
a subset of aritifical intelligence which provied machines the ability to learn automatically and improve from experience without being explicity programmed.<br/>
The difference between AI and machine learning is that machine learning is used in AI, AI a processin which you make a machine mimic the behavior of humans.<br/>
**Need of Machine learning**.<br/>
1)Increase in data generation.<br/>
2)Improve decsiosn making<br/>
3)Uncover patterns and trends in data.<br/>
4)solve complex problems.<br/>
## Key Topic 
**Algorithm** - a set of rules and statistical techniques used to learn patterns from data.<br/>
**Model**- trained by using machine learning algorithm.<br/>
**predictor Variable**-variae used to predict data.<br/>
**Response Variable**- output variable predicted by using predictor varibale.<br/>
**Traning Dat**a-model buit <br/>
**Testing data**-evaluted Data<br/>
## Machine learning Process 
+ Involved bulding a predictive model that can be used to find a solution ofr a problem statement.<br/>
## Steps
1)Define Objective-<br/>
example - what are we trying to predict? what are the target fetaures what is the input data ? what kind of problem are we facing ? binary classification ,clustering<br/>
**2)Data Gathering**-<br/>
example- kind of data? is it avaiable and hwo can i get 
**3)Data Prepartion**-<br/>
- data cleaning -getting rid of inconsistencies in data such as missing values or redundant varibles.<br/>
**4)Exploratory Data Analysis**-<br/>
 -understanding the patterns and trends in the data.<br/>
  useful insights are drawn and correlations between the varables are understood.<br/>
**5)Building a machine learning model**-<br/>
trainigndata  and testing data<br/>
**6)Model evalution and optimization**-<br/>
accuracy is calculated or any further imorvement in the model.<br/>
**7)Predictions**-<br/>
  final outcome is predicted.
