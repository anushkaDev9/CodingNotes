# Big O Notation
It is a way of expressing the complexity relates to the number of items that an algorithm has to deal with.<br/>
**Time complexity**- number of steps required to complete an alogrithm.<br/>
**Memory complexity**- memeory required to run an alogrithm.<br/>
| Big -O  | Time complexity  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| O(1)  | constant  |
|O(logn)  |Logarithmic|
|O(n) |linear|
|aO(n^2)|Quadratic|<br/>
