# Polymorphism
+ means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.<br/>
+ allows us to perform a single action in different ways.<br/>
+ think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound .<br/>
<pre>
 class Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
    Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object
    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
  }
}
</pre>
# Important Points 
**Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?**<br/>
- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
