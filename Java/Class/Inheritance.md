# Inheritance
+ it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.<br/>
   + subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class.<br/>
   + superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.<br/>
+ inherit from a class, use the extends keyword
  <pre>
    class Vehicle {
  protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute
  public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method
    System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create a myCar object
    Car myCar = new Car();

    // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
    myCar.honk();

    // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
    System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
  }
}

# Imporant Points ðŸ›‘
+ If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the final keyword
