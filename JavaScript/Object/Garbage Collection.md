# Garbage Collection <br/>
+ Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.<br/>
+ Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.<br/>
+ Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole, as weâ€™ve seen in the example above.<br/>
+ Modern engines implement advanced algorithms of garbage collection.<br/>
