# Loops
## While Loop 
while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
<pre>
  while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
</pre>
## Do while 
will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
<pre>
  do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
</pre>
### Difference between do while and while

| While       | Do while        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
