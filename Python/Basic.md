Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
<pre>
  x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
</pre>
# Casting 
<pre>
  x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
</pre>
# Get the Type
+ the data type of a variable with the type() function.<br/>
<pre>
  x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
</pre>
# Global Variables
+  that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.<br/>
+ To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.<br/>
# Data Types 

## Important points 
+ String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:<br/>
+ Variable names are case-sensitive.
