**POSITION** - property sets how an element is positioned in a document.(TOP,RIGHT,BOTTOM.LEFT)
### Different types of position values
+ **1)Static**-The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.iT is the  default value.
+ **2)Relative**-The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static. 
+ **3)Absolute**- the element is positioned relative to its closet posotioned ancestor or on the top left. 
+ **4)fixed**- the element is fixed at it's position even while scorrling top to bottom. 
+ **5)Sticky**-  is positioned based on the user's scroll position. <br/>
